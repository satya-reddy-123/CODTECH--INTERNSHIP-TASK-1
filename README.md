OVERVIEW OF PROJECT OF LED BLINKING 
LED blinking is one of the most basic and introductory projects in electronics and microcontroller programming. It involves controlling an LED (Light Emitting Diode) to turn on and off repeatedly at a specified interval. This exercise is frequently used as a beginner's project to help individuals get familiar with microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other development boards.

KEYCOMPONENTS:
LED: A semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it.
Resistor: Limits the current passing through the LED to prevent it from burning out.
Microcontroller/Processor: Used to control the LED by sending digital HIGH (ON) or LOW (OFF) signals to its connected pin.

WORKING PRINCIPLE:
The LED operates by forward-biasing the semiconductor junction. When a suitable voltage is applied across the LED, it lights up. The microcontroller sends either a HIGH (usually +5V or +3.3V) to the LED to turn it on or a LOW (0V) to turn it off.

APPLICATIONS: 
Debugging: The LED can provide visual feedback when certain events occur in the code.
Status Indicators: Blinking LEDs are often used to indicate power, connectivity status (e.g., Wi-Fi routers), or errors.
Timers and Alerts: LEDs can blink at different rates to indicate timing events, alarms, or countdowns.
